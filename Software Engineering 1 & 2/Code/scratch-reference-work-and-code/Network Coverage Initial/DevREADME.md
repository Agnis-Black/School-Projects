This folder holds the following files:

networkTest-Navigator.js & testpage.html - JavaScript File & HTML File
This JavaScript file contains code to run Network tests locally from the computer in connection to two separate approaches: using the Mozilla Network Information API and an Algorithm provided from a website that many JavaScript programmers use to run network speed tests. Drag and drop or, alternatively, open the HTML page (testpage.html) in Google Chrome only (not Safari, will look into Firefox for compatibility) to run these tests.

networkTest-Ookla - Python File
This Python file contains code to run Network tests using the SpeedTest-CLI API from Ookla (more famously known for their speedtest.net website). Although it takes a couple seconds for the Mbps data to generate, it provides an accurate reading of both download and upload speeds from the local host. You can run this file using python3 on any command line (developed using VSCode with python3 installed).
